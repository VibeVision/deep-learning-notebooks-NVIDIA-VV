But what if we cannot find a pre-trained model that does exactly what you need, and what if we do not have a sufficiently large dataset to train a model from scratch? In this case, there is a very helpful technique we can use called [transfer learning](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/02/07/what-is-transfer-learning/).\n",

    "With transfer learning, we take a pre-trained model and retrain it on a task that has some overlap with the original training task. A good analogy for this is an artist who is skilled in one medium, such as painting, who wants to learn to practice in another medium, such as charcoal drawing. We can imagine that the skills they learned while painting would be very valuable in learning how to draw with charcoal. \n",

    "As an example in deep learning, say we have a pre-trained model that is very good at recognizing different types of cars, and we want to train a model to recognize types of motorcycles. A lot of the learnings of the car model would likely be very useful, for instance the ability to recognize headlights and wheels. \n",

In this case, a model trained from scratch would likely memorize the training data quickly, but not be able to generalize well to new data.

This means that when we train, we will not update the base layers from the pre-trained model. Instead we will only update the new layers that we add on the end for our new classification. We freeze the initial layers because we want to retain the learning achieved from training on the ImageNet dataset. If they were unfrozen at this stage, we would likely destroy this valuable information. There will be an option to unfreeze and train these layers later, in a process called fine-tuning.\n",
