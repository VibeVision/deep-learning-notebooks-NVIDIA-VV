    "So far, we've executed customer requests sequentially, in the order they have arrived at the server, and used a static batch of size 8 for any requests to our server. This has not only left our GPUs heavily underutilized, but has also significantly affected the latency of responses received from the server. This is not an uncommon situation. Unless you are developing an application that processes large volumes of data in batch, you will likely be sending individual inference requests from the user application, leading to even further underutilization. As we have seen in the previous notebook, model optimizations do help considerably to accelerate model execution.  However, they do not change the fact that when serving is implemented naively, the nature of the inference workload leads to GPU underutilization.\n",

    "# 2.1 Concurrent Model Execution\n",
    "The Triton architecture allows multiple models and/or multiple instances of the same model to execute in parallel on a single GPU. The following figure shows an example with two models: `model0` and `model1`. Assuming Triton is not currently processing any request, when two requests arrive simultaneously, one for each model, Triton immediately schedules both of them onto the GPU, and the GPUâ€™s hardware scheduler begins working on both computations in parallel. </br>\n",

    "Triton provides an instance-group feature that allows each model to specify how many parallel executions of that model should be allowed. Each such enabled parallel execution is referred to as an *execution instance*. By default, Triton gives each model a single execution instance, which means that only a single execution of the model is allowed to be in progress at a time as shown in the above figure. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instance Groups\n",
    "By using the *instance-group* setting, the number of execution instances for a model can be increased. The following figure shows model execution when `model1` is configured to allow three execution instances. As shown in the figure, the first three `model1` inference requests are immediately executed in parallel on the GPU. The fourth `model1` inference request must wait until one of the first three executions completes before beginning.\n",
