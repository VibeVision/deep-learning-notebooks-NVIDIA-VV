       "      <td>A common MSH2 mutation in English and North American HNPCC families: origin, phenotypic expression, and sex specific differences in colorectal cancer . The frequency , origin , and phenotypic expression of a germline MSH2 gene mutation previously identified in seven kindreds with hereditary non-polyposis cancer syndrome (HNPCC) was investigated . The mutation ( A-- &gt; T at nt943 + 3 ) disrupts the 3 splice site of exon 5 leading to the deletion of this exon from MSH2 mRNA and represents the only frequent MSH2 mutation so far reported . Although this mutation was initially detected in four of 33 colorectal cancer families analysed from eastern England , more extensive analysis has reduced the frequency to four of 52 ( 8 % ) English HNPCC kindreds analysed . In contrast , the MSH2 mutation was identified in 10 of 20 ( 50 % ) separately identified colorectal families from Newfoundland . To investigate the origin of this mutation in colorectal cancer families from England ( n = 4 ) , Newfoundland ( n = 10 ) , and the United States ( n = 3 ) , haplotype analysis using microsatellite markers linked to MSH2 was performed . Within the English and US families there was little evidence for a recent common origin of the MSH2 splice site mutation in most families . In contrast , a common haplotype was identified at the two flanking markers ( CA5 and D2S288 ) in eight of the Newfoundland families . These findings suggested a founder effect within Newfoundland similar to that reported by others for two MLH1 mutations in Finnish HNPCC families . We calculated age related risks of all , colorectal , endometrial , and ovarian cancers in nt943 + 3 A-- &gt; T MSH2 mutation carriers ( n = 76 ) for all patients and for men and women separately . For both sexes combined , the penetrances at age 60 years for all cancers  and for colorectal cancer were 0 . 86 and 0 . 57 , respectively . The risk of colorectal cancer was significantly higher ( p &lt; 0 . 01 ) in males than females ( 0 . 63 v 0 . 30 and 0 . 84 v 0 . 44 at ages 50 and 60 years , respectively ) . For females there was a high risk of endometrial cancer ( 0 . 5 at age 60 years ) and premenopausal ovarian cancer ( 0 . 2 at 50 years ) . These intersex differences in colorectal cancer risks have implications for screening programmes and for attempts to identify colorectal cancer susceptibility modifiers .</td>\n",

Age of onset ( AO ) of Huntington disease ( HD) is known to be correlated with the length of an expanded CAG repeat in the HD gene . Apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) genotype , in turn , is known to influence AO in Alzheimer disease , rendering the APOE gene a likely candidate to affect AO in other neurological diseases too . We therefore determined APOE genotype and normal CAG repeat length in the HD gene for 138 HD patients who were previously analysed with respect to CAG repeat length . Genotyping for APOE was performed blind to clinical information . In addition to highlighting the effect of the normal repeat length upon AO in maternally inherited HD and in male patients , we show that the APOE epsilon2epsilon3 genotype is associated with significantly earlier AO in males than in females . Such a sex difference in AO was not apparent for any of the other APOE genotypes . Our findings suggest that subtle differences in the course of the neurodegeneration  in HD  may allow interacting genes to exert gender specific effects upon AO.</td>\n",
